            <p>I am Hamza Ahmad, I am 23 y/o, I studied mechanical engineering at JUST, I was among the best btw. My interest in coding and programming has seriously started during my 3rd year of my bachelor, I actually took many exceptions to take coursed related to AI and machine learning at different departments, and I really liked all of it. I am also so much into robotics, I actually published a cute paper with 2 of my colleagues under the supervision of two doctors about a hexapod, it was so much fun, especially since it got me studying linear algebra on my own from different books. I am yet to begin tho, I am so excited about the course I am taking now, and I hope to get to build something significant someday, I aim to have my own company, in order to do real engineering, however, I will do my best regardless. </p>
