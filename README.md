# About-Me
### Changelog

* June 7th

I built the basic structure for the web page, adding the necessary markup and styles in additon to the necessary files. At first I only included the yes/no quiz with only if/ else statement.

* June 8th 

I added more to the project in terms of styles and elements, I also added two quizes, one for number guessing, and one for giving at least one correct answer knowing that there were 3. Also, I added two lists, one for my work experience, and the other for my education history.

* 9th of June 

We have moved all the logic to the main three functions, one of them accepts an argument, which is a list containing other lists that themselves include the questions, correct answers and responses. Only for the first question we did some restructuring, but for the other two we only cleaned our code and moved it inside wrapper functions to reduce the need for repetition.
