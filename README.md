### Changelog

* June 7th

I built the basic structure for the web page, adding the necessary markup and styles in additon to the necessary files. At first I only included the yes/no quiz with only if/ else statement.

* June 8th 

I added more to the project in terms of styles and elements, I also added two quizes, one for number guessing, and one for giving at least one correct answer knowing that there were 3. Also, I added two lists, one for my work experience, and the other for my education history.
